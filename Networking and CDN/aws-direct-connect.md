* [Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/)
    + Dedicate WAN link to AWS
    + Alternative backend to Virtual Private Gateway instead of "vanilla internet"
    + Doesn't use encryption?
    + Virtual interfaces are either private - access to a VPC, or public - access to AWS public endpoints. Can have multiple interfaces per connection if its fast enough.
